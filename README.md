# My Text Editor Project

## Introduction
Welcome to my text editor project! This endeavor is inspired by the fantastic tutorial "Build Your Own Text Editor." In this project, we'll be creating a text editor in C, with some personalized changes. This text editor consists of C code, all contained in a single file, with no external dependencies.

## Motivation
Building a text editor from scratch is an exciting journey that allows us to delve into the core principles of programming. This project not only aims to create a functional text editor but also serves as a hands-on exploration of C programming concepts.

## Future Plans 
Working on adding functionality that will allow users to search for text! This feature will be based on the Booyer Moore string matching algorithm and will be based on 'grep'.
